DWA15 Project 4
---------------

Description
-----------
This version of The Cat's Meow Comic Creator is an extension of both my P2 Meower microblog and my P3 The Cat's Meow Comic Creator app.  Instead of posting "meows" as in P2, a user can now save/share comic strips that they have created through the site.  Some new features have also been added to both the "microblog" aspect and the comic creations.

Features
--------
* Users can either share their creations or keep them private.
* Messaging is displayed when a user reaches a limit to a particular feature while creating comics (max characters/ballons per panel, text for title, etc).
* Users can now supply a user name during sign up - this will be used to identify the user instead of their email address.
* Comic strip characters can now be resized before being added to a comic panel.
* Both characters and text balloons can now be deleted from the comic strip.
* In addition to the "Print" feature, users can save their creations to the database to be viewed at any time.
* Added JS "required" validations to input fields of Signup and Login for better user experience - clientside validations are still present as well.

Javascript Uses
---------------
* Form field validations of Signup and Login
* Accordion login/signup form of main landing page
* Tab menu and functionality of creating custom comic strips in "Create" mode.
